# s-f repository factory adapter

Status: SF-00 baseline reconciliation.
Authority: this file configures the reusable workflow for the `spsoftwarefc/s-f` repository. It grants no authority over repositories where s-f may later be installed.

## Purpose

Build and qualify a portable, repository-local software factory that supports a developer or coding agent from planning through deployment while preserving each target project's own requirements, architecture, tests, CI and release authority.

The CTJ bot is an extraction source only. Trading contracts, stage ledgers, exchange procedures, account credentials, venue qualification and historical completion records are outside this repository's authority.

## Operating rules

- One implementation package is active at a time unless explicitly authorized otherwise.
- Every implementation package starts with a committed work order.
- Prefer local or ChatGPT-side verification during development.
- Use GitHub-hosted Actions only when a hosted run proves a claim that local verification cannot.
- Do not duplicate push and pull-request runs merely for presentation.
- No reviewer request or approving-review count is a factory acceptance prerequisite.
- Merge and deployment remain separate effects requiring the user's active cadence/authorization.
- Missing evidence is unknown, not success.

## Current merge cadence

For SF-00, PRs #1 through #4 are intentionally stacked. Do not merge an earlier PR in isolation. After PR #4 completes SF-00 acceptance, merge the stack to `main` in dependency order.

## Instruction ownership

| Location | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | Repository entry point and operating boundaries |
| `SKILLS.md` | Selection of repository-local factory skills |
| `.agents/skills/` | Single-source skill bodies |
| `docs/factory/WORKFLOW.md` | Reusable production lifecycle |
| `docs/factory/WORK_ORDER.md` | Work-package checkpoints and evidence expectations |
| `docs/factory/PROJECT.md` | s-f-specific configuration and authority boundary |
| `docs/factory/work-orders/` | Package declarations and package-specific acceptance |
| `docs/factory/EXTRACTION.md` | Source provenance and import classification |

`CLAUDE.md` and later host adapters remain thin references to `AGENTS.md`; they do not copy policy bodies.

## Resource policy

Current GitHub repository size is small and SF-00 adds no Actions workflow. The limiting resource is hosted execution, not repository storage. During implementation:

1. run focused tests locally/tool-side;
2. run the applicable local acceptance suite once on a stable candidate;
3. trigger hosted CI only when it is required for a provider-specific claim;
4. reuse valid exact-candidate evidence rather than rerunning unchanged jobs;
5. never treat a skipped or unavailable hosted check as success.

Self-hosted CI is not part of SF-00 and is not placed on a production VPS by default.

## Current package

`docs/factory/work-orders/SF-00.md` defines the active reconciliation. Later packages implement the CLI, schemas, inventory, installation, verified CI evidence, security adapters and release/deployment lifecycle.
